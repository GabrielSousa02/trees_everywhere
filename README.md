### About this project
This project was built with the intention of putting the best practices
for software development I am currently improving, such as:
* TDD - Or almost...
* Automated Tests
* CI pipeline with `GitHub Actions`
* Auto generated `docs` for the `RESTful` `API`
* Django framework best practices

And some other things I can't remember at the moment of writing this `README`.

All the `PRs` have their original branch on `GitHub` with the intention of
demonstrating the implementation/fix/enhancement journey I took, when practicing/learning
during the coding process.

You're more than welcome to peek, copy, duplicate, read, comment, learn from, this repo! ðŸ¤“
