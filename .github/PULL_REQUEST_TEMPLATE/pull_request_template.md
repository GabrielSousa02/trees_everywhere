## What?
Adding new feature to the `TreePlanting` process. New way of tracking all `PlantedTrees`

## Why?
The system was outdated in terms of tracking service.

## How?
Including map functionality that now enables the `TreePlanter` to pin the geolocation
on the mapping service.

## Testing?
Tests were implemented and are all passing.

## Screenshots (optional)

## Anything Else?
We will need to improve the `DB` query filtes currently running to improve performance
once we have geolocation being added.
